Prof. Manu Kapur is currently a Professor and Chair of Learning Sciences and Higher Education at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. His research delves in the sphere of education and pedagogy oftening using unconventional methods to create better learning mechanisms. He conceptualized the notion of [*productive failure*](http://www.manukapur.com/research/productive-failure/) and has used it to explore the hidden efficacies in the seemingly failed efforts of small groups solving complex problems collaboratively in an online environment.

You can find more details about his research on his [personal webpage](http://www.manukapur.com/).
