Philipp Man had a brilliant idea for a start-up while sitting in a lecture hall. He started from his kitchen in 2013 and now four years later he oversees 150 employees in 4 countries and has raised over 18 million dollars in funding. His start-up, **[Chronext](https://www.chronext.com/)**, is an online marketplace for luxury watches and has already carved a niche for itself in the market.

Philipp tells us his story and his views on how to build and effectively run a successful start-up. Sidenote: he's hiring! He talks about what he looks for in potential employees in the episode.
