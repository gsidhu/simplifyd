Prof. Sebastiano Cantalupo says that he has fancied unraveling the mysteries of the Universe for as long as he can remember. A couple of years ago he got a chance of doing exactly that when he was a member of the team at University of California, Santa Cruz, that took *"photographs"* of the cosmic web. He tells us how it was all done explaining the jargon on the fly.
