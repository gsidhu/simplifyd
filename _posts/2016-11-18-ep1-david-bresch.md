_What measures can we take to minimize the damage caused by natural disasters like tropical cyclones and volcanic eruptions? How do advancements in climate science help make better economic and politicaldecisions? And how does a physicist end up as a policy framework specialist at a re-insurance company?_

To answer these questions, we interviewed [Prof. David Bresch](https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.html?persid=49820) who is an internationally recognized expert in climate and weather risks. He has been recently-appointed as a full professor in the Department of Environmental Systems Science at ETH Zurich.

The audio and video podcast are linked below. 

But before that, here’s a brief introduction to the topic followed by links for further reading. 

**What is weather risk management (WRM)?** 

Simply: 

> _"Weather risk management is a type of risk management done by organizations to address potential financial losses caused by unusual weather."_ 

(Thanks, [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_risk_management))

**Who needs this kind of analysis?** 

Any industry whose business can be affected by unusual weather can profit from this type of risk analysis. Examples include agriculture, construction, real estate, logistics, retail and more. 

**How does WRM help?** 

Prof. Bresch talks about a study he conducted in Maharashtra, India. (Maharashtra has been undergoing a massive drought for the last five years.[[4]](#four)[[5]](#five)) In his words: 
<blockquote> ... the people figured that if you do better soil management, switch to drip irrigation and probably think about which crop fares best in this environment; independent of climate change you could continue to basically manage the agricultural sector in Maharashtra in India. It doesn’t come for free. That was often the problem. It needs investment, it needs investment also over time, it needs maintenance. But that can only happen if the awareness is there and the opportunities and options are on the table.</blockquote> 

In most cases the job of a climate risk expert is to provide the relevant weather-related information to the stakeholders and sometimes it even goes into the implementation phase where they supply techniques and technologies that can help mitigate a crisis. 


**Give me a better explanation.** 

Here's an easy-to-understand example offered by the [Weather Risk Management Association](http://wrma.org/what-is-weather-risk-management/): 
<blockquote> Farmers in certain parts of the southern United States desire to plant crops as early as possible in the season. If they are unable to plant early in the season, they have to switch their planting strategies and they lose the opportunity to plant two crops. The critical factor is rainfall. If there is excessive rainfall early in the season, farmers cannot work the soil and may not be able to move equipment onto their fields because of the soft ground. Excessive rainfall creates additional expense and lost income. 
A farm cooperative offered a program to its members backed by a weather risk structure. If rainfall exceeded 9.5 inches in total in the months of February and March, the farmer would receive a single payment based on lost income and extra expense due to the inability to till and plant in the early spring.</blockquote> 


**Is there a simpler example?** 

Yes! The meteorology departments (like [MeteoSwiss](http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html)in Switzerland) provide up-to-date weather information on their websites and mobile apps which can help local businesses make better decisions. For example, if it’s a 90% chance that it’s going to snow heavily in a certain region, a _smart _logistics company will try to divert its routes and perhaps choose another mode of transport. Or even simply, if it’s predicted to be a really hot summer, an ice-cream truck will stock more and maybe even start selling lemonade. 

And again from the WRMA: 

*   Insufficient rainfall requires increased sprinkling of golf courses and other recreational facilities. 
*   Snowfall totals affect the cost of maintaining highways in the winter. 
*   Combinations of snowfall and temperature are critical to ski resort revenues and the sale of ski-related apparel and equipment. 
*   Average wind speeds relate to the general efficiency of wind turbine generated electrical power. 
*   The combination of rain and temperature play a meaningful role in determining the demand for lawn fertilizer and swimming pool treatment chemicals. 

**Do I still need to listen to the podcast?** 

If you want to know the nitty-gritty of how weather risk management works, why stakeholder analysis is important, how climate models are used to make policy decisions, what weather reinsurance is and if it’s any better than life insurance, or if you are looking for advice on how to become a climate risk expert like Prof. Bresch - yes, you should really listen to the podcast. 

In case you don’t, well, alright. Hopefully you’ll find a topic of your interest in some of our future episodes.

1.  [Weather Risk Management for Agriculture and Agri-Business in Developing Countries](https://agriskmanagementforum.org/sites/agriskmanagementforum.org/files/Documents/Weather_Risk_Management.pdf): This book chapter is a good introduction to WRM as it argues the need for it; compares traditional and upcoming practices; and provides acase-study. From the book:  
_"The first part argues that weather risk causes substantial inefficiencies in developing countries; agri-businesses, faced with underdeveloped formal financial markets, have to rely on traditional WRM that is associated with underinvestment and overdiversification. We discuss how new WRM can overcome the pitfalls of traditional WRM and have a large development impact. In the second section, we discuss the range of potential uses of new WRM. The final part turns to the operational aspects of a new WRM, studying in detail the case of WRM for cereals in Morocco."_
