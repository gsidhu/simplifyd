The narrative around social media has been revolving around privacy concerns for quite some time now. But there is more to Facebook or Twitter than covert data collection and shadow profiling. Dr. David Garcia is a researcher in computational social science whose main area of expertise is user behaviour on the world wide web. From **[sentiment analysis based on the way we type](http://dgarcia.eu/the-qwerty-effect-on-the-web/)** to **[identifying gender bias in Wikipedia](http://dgarcia.eu/its-a-mans-wikipedia-assessing-gender-inequality-in-an-online-encyclopedia/)**, or **[the collapse of Friendster](http://dgarcia.eu/social-resilience-in-online-communities-the-autopsy-of-friendster/)**, his work has raised questions and been featured in top-tier tech news outlets. (**[Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/friendster-autopsy/)**, **[MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601315/the-best-of-the-physics-arxiv-week-ending-april-23-2016/)**, **[Motherboard Vice](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikipedias-gender-problem-has-finally-been-quantified)** to name a few)

Dr. David Garcia is currently a senior researcher at the [Chair of Systems Design](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich, Zurich. You can follow his exciting work on **[his personal website.](http://dgarcia.eu/)**
