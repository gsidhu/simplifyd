Prof. Vijay Natarajan from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, joined us to talk about data visualization. He works with what he calls "scientific data" - data that comes from imaging devices and satellites and such, not the kind that Facebook is collecting on you. His work he explains is to create such visualizations so that the experts can draw conclusions from it.

Vijay Natarajan is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. You can find out more about his research on **[his personal webpage](http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~vijayn/).**
