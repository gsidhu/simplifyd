Prof. Jing Wang looks at up and coming nanotechnology (like carbon nanotubes!) and goes - *"Hmm I wonder if inhaling this could kill someone."* Morbid as it sounds, he then tries to make sure that doesn't happen. He spoke to us about nanoparticles, airplane emissions, carbon nanotubes and much more.

Jing Wang is an Assistant Professor of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering at the Institute of Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich. You can find out more about his research on [his webpage](https://www.baug.ethz.ch/en/department/professors/personen-detail.html?persid=173881).
