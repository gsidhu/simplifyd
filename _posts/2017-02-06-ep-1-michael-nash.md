In Episode One we speak to Prof. Michael Nash and learn about a lot of bio- things. Bio-fuels, bio-glue, bio-police, bio-molecules... some of these names may not be as scientific as the others but they are every bit as fascinating.

You can follow Prof. Nash's work on [his website](http://www.chemie.unibas.ch/~nashm/The_Nash_Lab/Home.html). He works on a wide range of exciting topics revolving around engineered biological nanomaterials. He's looking to hire students at all levels of study, so if you like his research make sure you take a look at the [positions available](http://www.chemie.unibas.ch/~nashm/The_Nash_Lab/Positions_Available.html) in his lab.

If you like our podcast, we would love it if you shared it with your friends and colleagues, and gave us feedback in the comments section below. 

We publish a new episode every week. Check out our [Upcoming page](/upcoming) to see what's coming next.

And now... give it up for Michael Nash!
