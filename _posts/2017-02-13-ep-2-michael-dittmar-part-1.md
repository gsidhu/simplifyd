*Note: This is Part 1 of this episode. Part 2 comes out this Thursday.*

In episode two we meet Dr. Michael Dittmar who talks to us about things varying from the oil crisis to nuclear fusion and data analysis to sustainable living.

Michael Dittmar is a senior scientist in the department of physics at ETH Zurich and works in particle physics at CERN. He offers a two part elective course at ETH called *Energy and Environment in the 21st Century*. If you are at ETH, we highly recommend this course. You can find the course content along with related news and journal publications on **[his course webpage](http://ihp-lx2.ethz.ch/energy21/).**
