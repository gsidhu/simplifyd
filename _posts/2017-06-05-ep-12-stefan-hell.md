In the final episode of Season 1, we met [Prof. Stefan Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Hell) - a Nobel prize winning physicist who in his own words was "forced into becoming an applied physicist." (!) He is known for developing a technique of optical microscopy that broke the 125 year reign of Abbe's limit and today allows us to look down at the molecular scale with just a simple microscope. 

We talked to him about what kept him motivated, about his views on how present-day science works, and much more! If you're a budding scientist or just someone looking for inspiration from a great man, do listen to what Prof. Hell has to say.

Listen to his lectures delivered at the prestigious **[Wolfgang Pauli Lecture Series](http://www.video.ethz.ch/speakers/pauli/2017.html)** at ETH Zurich here.

Prof. Stefan Hell is currently one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, Germany. You can follow his exciting work on **[his group's webpage.](http://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/hell)**
