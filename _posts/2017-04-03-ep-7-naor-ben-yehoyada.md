In Episode 7, Prof. Naor Ben-Yehoyada talked to us about the time he spent on the fish trawlers in the Mediterranean Sea and how his research evolved from there into studying illegal migration and the mafia in Sicily. He provided incredible insights into how research in social anthropology is conducted.
